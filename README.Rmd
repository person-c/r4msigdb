The goal of r4msigdb is to query for the MSigDB.

## Installation

You can install the development version of r4msigdb like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install('snowGlint/r4msigdb')
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to query for the MSigDB:

```{r example}
library(r4msigdb)
query(species = 'Hs', pathway = 'FERROPTOSIS')
query(species = 'Hs', symbols = c('PTPRC', 'TP53'))
```

You can unlist the symbol column using `.unlist = TRUE`

```{r}
query(species = 'Hs', .unlist = TRUE)
```

You could query for the MSigDB by your own way if you are familiar with `data.table`

```{r}
query(species = 'Hs')[.('H'), by = .(collection_name)]
```
